        <h3>The new aesthetics of goods</h3>
        <p>The association aimed at "refining commercial work in the interaction of art, industry and crafts, through education, propaganda and unified statements on relevant issues". He thus continued the already existing approaches of the reform movements inspired by John Ruskin . With reference to a morally based concept of quality, an attempt was made to establish a new aesthetics of goods for industrial arts and crafts production, which had hitherto been content with copies and adaptations of old craft forms with their often rich ornamentation. According to art historian Christian Demandbuilt “the aesthetic education agenda of the […] Werkbund […] on the direct persuasiveness of concepts such as material, form and work justice”. [1] The central concern was the search for a new design (also known as " form follows function "), which was determined by "purpose", "material" and "construction", which was also known as "objectivity" - and which in the Then, in the 1920s, it was to be addressed again under the topos “ New Objectivity ”. This demand for a technically and aesthetically high-quality production was set in programmatic contrast to the previous practice of industrialized arts and crafts, which seemed only oriented towards profit.
        </p>
        <p>In order to counteract the declining quality of applied arts that was lamented in this context, a design appropriate to the specific conditions of machine production was to be developed, which was characterized in particular by the lack of ornamentation and the simplicity of the forms. In the numerous publications and exhibitions of the Werkbund, this new aesthetic was to be helped to gain greater popularity among consumers and manufacturers alike through exemplary designs of everyday objects.
        </p>
        <h4>From sofa cushions to urban planning</h4>
        <p>In addition, under the expansive motto from sofa cushions to urban planning , it was hoped that what was then called the “modern style of our time” of epochal durability could be established far beyond industrial production for the whole world of everyday objects, including architecture. In the background was Gottfried Semper's famous prognosis that the new beginning in architecture could only come from applied arts and the arts industries. Accordingly, with regard to the spread of the new forms, special expectations were placed on the market-dominating forces of industrial mass production, and it was ultimately desired to set up a kind of "taste cartel" in this way (see the speech by Hermann Muthesiusat the Cologne Werkbund exhibition in 1914). However, at the Cologne exhibition there was a dispute between the representatives of typification (Muthesius) and those of individualism (van de Velde) (the so-called typification debate).
        </p>
        <p>Among the Bund's most respected critics were Adolf Loos and Werner Sombart , with Loos attacking the association's artistic aspirations and emphasizing that only unconditional functionalism would lead to the emergence of contemporary styles, while Sombart pointed out above all that the Werkbund's educational program was inevitable was doomed to fail. [3]In 2016, Christian Demand retrospectively stated that “the missionary furore that had accompanied the activities of the Werkbund for decades [...] [died] in the early 1970s with the sobering realization that in a society that was becoming increasingly pluralistic in all areas of life, mobility and prosperity, whose wishes and technological possibilities were constantly expanding, even among experts it was simply no longer possible to achieve a binding aesthetic consensus."
